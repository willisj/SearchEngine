	R A Frost</p>
<p>
	The general regulations for the Degree of the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) at the University of Windsor, as set out in section 1.5 of the Calendar of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research, will apply together with the more specific requirements for the degree of Ph.D. in Computer Science given in the following section. For admission, continuation in good standing, and graduation, students must satisfy both the general university regulations and the specific regulations for Computer Science.</p>
<h3>
	1&nbsp; Graduate Committee of the School of Computer Science</h3>
<p>
	The doctoral program will be administered by the Graduate Committee of the School of Computer Science, which consists of the Director of the School, the Doctoral Program Chair, the Master&rsquo;s Program Chair and Associate Chair, two elected graduate faculty members, and two elected graduate student representatives (when the doctoral program has students, one student will be from the doctoral program and one from the Master&rsquo;s program). The Graduate Committee&rsquo;s functions include: recommending the admission of applicants to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research; recommending a supervisor and an advisory committee for each doctoral applicant, doctoral curriculum matters, and advising on the graduate teaching schedule and graduate course offerings.</p>
<h3>
	2&nbsp; Admission Requirements</h3>
<p>
	In order to be considered for admission to the doctoral program in Computer Science, applicants must:</p>
<ol>
<li>
		Have completed a thesis-based Master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science, or, have completed a course-based Master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science, and have demonstrated to the Admissions Committee, the ability to conduct independent research through the completion of research-oriented project work or appropriate research experience in industry or academia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		Have been accepted by a supervisor with a commitment to provide an RAship of $4,000 per year for four years, and a guarantee in writing from the School of Computer Science to provide 8 semester GAships (The RAship and GAship are subject to satisfactory fulfillment of responsibilities)</li>
</ol>
<p>
	The admissions process in the School of Computer Science will be administered by a Doctoral Admissions Committee whose membership and terms of reference are given in a separate document approved by the Council of the School of Computer Science. The Doctoral Admissions Committee makes recommendations to the Graduate Committee of Computer Science, which in turn makes recommendations for admission to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research.</p>
<h3>
	3&nbsp; Supervisor and Doctoral&nbsp; Committee</h3>
<p>
	Prior to admission and registration, each student is accepted by a supervisor or two co-supervisors who is/are a member/s of the Graduate Faculty in the School of Computer Science, and who will advise on course selections, on research topic selection, and provide continuing help during the research activities. Within the first term of registration in the doctoral program, each student is also assigned a Doctoral Committee consisting of</p>

</ul>
<p>
	The qualifying/ exam, comprehensive examination, research proposal, and annual reports constitute the key checkpoints for each student&rsquo;s progress during the Ph.D. program.&nbsp; At each checkpoint, the Doctoral Committee meets to assess the student&rsquo;s progress. The committee discusses their assessment with the student and prepares a report and sends it to the Graduate Committee. If the progress is satisfactory, the Graduate Committee recommends that the student proceed to the next checkpoint. Otherwise, it may either recommend that the student repeat the unsatisfactory component at a later date, or be withdrawn from the program. The student has the opportunity to formally respond to the report if he or she wishes to do so. Each of these requirements is explained below with more details, in a separate subsection.</p>
<h3>
	5&nbsp; Qualifying Examination &nbsp;</h3>
<p>
	The qualifying examination must be taken by all students entering the doctoral program. This exam is managed by the Graduate Committee of the School of Computer Science. The qualifying examination is intended to ensure that the student has a mastery of the fundamentals in Computer Science in order to undertake research. This is a breadth<br />
	requirement in that it does not require the student to be able to undertake research in each of the fundamental areas. Rather, the student must demonstrate knowledge, in each of the fundamental areas, at a level that would be expected of a graduate from a four-year honours Computer Science university-degree program:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		Calculus&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>
		Linear algebra&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>
		Basic probability</li>
<li>
		Discrete mathematics</li>
<li>
		Numerical analysis and computations</li>
<li>
		File structures and database systems</li>
<li>
		Computer architecture</li>
<li>
		Data structures and algorithms</li>
<li>
		Operating systems</li>
<li>
		Software Engineering</li>
<li>
		Programming</li>
<li>
		Algorithm Design</li>
<li>
		Complexity Analysis</li>
<li>
		Networking and Internet</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The qualifying exams are organized twice a year: in April (for students entering in January) and in December (for students entering in September). The general qualifying exam contains different parts corresponding to each of the above areas, so that the student can later use the first and second option to retake failed components.</p>
<p>
	The student must obtain at least an overall grade of B in the tests and/or course works done for the qualifying examination. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	6&nbsp; Graduate Courses</h3>
<p>
	Each student must complete no less than two and usually no more than four graduate Computer Science courses, not including those taken for credit in a Master&rsquo;s degree, and not including seminar or thesis courses. Graduate course selection will be determined by the student&rsquo;s Doctoral Committee. Graduate credit will be given for a grade of B- or higher in a graduate course.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	7 Comprehensive Examination</h3>
<p>
	The comprehensive examination is one in which the student is asked to demonstrate a reasonable mastery of the field of specialization; it is designed to test the student&#39;s command of knowledge and ability to integrate that knowledge, after completion of all or most of the graduate course work. Normally, this examination is completed during the second year of graduate study and is a prerequisite to admission to candidacy.</p>
<h3>
	8 Admission to Candidacy</h3>
<p>
	A student is admitted to candidacy when the student has passed the qualifying examination, has completed all or most of the required graduate courses, and has passed the comprehensive examination. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	9 Research Proposal (after admission to candidacy)</h3>
<p>
	After admission to candidacy, preparation for doctoral research involves assimilating the most important research papers on the topic; understanding how they relate to each other and identifying valid open research problems.&nbsp; The candidate must write a report, as part of the research proposal, containing a survey of work in the area, identification of the problem s/he has selected and a research plan with suggested approaches to solve the problem, and timelines and checkpoints. The report is then presented during an oral presentation to the Doctoral Committee.</p>
<p>
	The report should clearly outline a research problem on which the student proposes to work in an area of Computer Science, and a research plan with suggested approaches to solve the problem. The report and the performance on the oral presentation should demonstrate the student&rsquo;s ability to do independent work in reviewing the relevant literature, identifying the research problem, suggesting and developing new approaches to solve the problem, and reporting the results. The literature review should not exceed that normally expected in a Ph.D. dissertation. The student must send the written report to each member on the Doctoral Committee at least two weeks before the date set for the oral presentation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The student must present the report to the Doctoral Committee in the presence of at least one graduate student representative on the Graduate Committee, who has already been admitted for the Ph.D. candidacy. The graduate student representative does not sit in as an examiner. His or her role is only to attest to the fairness of the process. The candidate must convince the Doctoral Committee that he or she has the abilities outlined above and that he or she has a commanding knowledge of the research area.&nbsp; The scope of the knowledge that the student must demonstrate during questions is not limited to the report; it covers the research area. The student&rsquo;s supervisor is normally responsible for the definition of what constitutes the breadth for the research area.&nbsp; The public is allowed during the presentation and may ask questions, but cannot participate in the evaluation process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The research proposal must be satisfactorily completed after admission to candidacy and within two years after entering the Ph.D. program.</p>
<p>
	If a student switches a supervisor or a research area, the Graduate Committee will determine whether the student must present another research proposal or not in the new research area.</p>
<h3>
	10&nbsp; Annual Progress Report&nbsp; &nbsp;</h3>
<p>
	Each student must complete an annual report that is to be evaluated by his/her Doctoral Committee. The purpose of the progress report is to assess the student&rsquo;s progress in his/her research and to ensure continual and constructive interaction with the Doctoral Committee. An assessment of the report is prepared by the student&rsquo;s Doctoral Committee after meeting with the student to assess his/her progress made up to that point in the program. The Doctoral Committee sends the report and assessment to the Graduate Committee which will review it. If the report demonstrates insufficient progress, the Graduate Committee may send formal warning to the student or make other decisions regarding the student&rsquo;s registration in the program.&nbsp; Progress reports are submitted each year by the 30th of April for students entering in September, and by the 30th of August for students entering in January.</p>
<h3>
	11&nbsp; Seminars &nbsp;</h3>
<p>
	Each Ph.D. student must present at least two publicly-announced seminars during the program, not including the proposal or dissertation defense. The purpose of the seminars is to ensure participation of each student in the academic life of the School of Computer Science. They also permit students to develop their oral presentation skills and to receive feedback on their research from the audience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Each seminar will be attended by the student&rsquo;s supervisor and at least one other member of the Doctoral Committee. All members of the Doctoral Committee who are present will assess the quality of the presentation.</p>
<p>
	For each successfully presented seminar, the student will complete a &ldquo;Ph.D. Student Seminar Form&rdquo; to be signed by the Doctoral Committee members who were present at the seminar and send it to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research.</p>
<h3>
	12&nbsp; Dissertation</h3>
<p>
	The largest part of doctoral work is original and independent research, conducted under the direction of the student&rsquo;s supervisor. This research is presented in a Ph.D. thesis written by the student. The dissertation must include significant and original research contributions to Computer Science. The thesis dissertation typically contains results from intense investigations following the research plan established in the research proposal that was submitted for admission to the Ph.D. candidacy.</p>
<h3>
	13&nbsp; Dissertation Defense (Final examination)</h3>
<p>
	The candidate will present the dissertation to the Doctoral Committee and an External Examiner at a public defense. The Chair of a Ph.D. defense will be the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research or designate, such as the Dean of a Faculty or senior member of graduate faculty from outside the program, to be named by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research at the time the defense is publicly announced. The chair is non-voting.</p>
<p>
	Questions will be permitted from the general audience at the discretion of the chair. The general audience may remain until the defense is completed and the committee begins its deliberations on the outcome. These deliberations are held in camera.</p>
<h3>
	14 Normal Progression</h3>
<p>
	Students entering the program with a thesis-based Master&rsquo;s degree would be expected to complete their doctoral program in three to four years. The following is the expected normal progression for a student in the Ph.D. program. &nbsp;</p>
