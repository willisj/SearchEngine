	<strong>No new bargaining dates for CUPE 1393</strong></div>
<div class="rtecenter">
	<strong>Talks ongoing with CUPE 1001</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	During collective bargaining negotiations with CUPE 1393, the University of Windsor has been consistent with its position on the issues of bumping and job evaluation. After a meeting with the mediator this week, the University is not confident at this time that CUPE 1393 has the flexibility needed to meaningfully address the issues of bumping and job evaluation. Therefore as of today, the University does not have any further bargaining dates scheduled with CUPE 1393. However, the University remains ready to return to the bargaining table at any time.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Talks continue with CUPE 1001 this week with the assistance of a mediator, which are scheduled until Friday, September 20. &nbsp;The University remains confident that an agreement can be reached with this group. CUPE 1001 will be in a legal strike position and the University will be in a legal lock out position at 12:01 am on September 23. In the event of a strike by CUPE 1001, the University intends to remain open and classes will continue with a reduced number of services available.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	CUPE 1393 represents approximately 281 technical, trades and professional staff at the University of Windsor.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	CUPE 1001 represents 118 full-time and 202 part-time housekeeping, grounds, maintenance and food services staff.</div>
<p><strong>Collective Agreements Ratified by Unifor Locals 195 and 2458</strong></p>
<p>	Today, the University of Windsor&rsquo;s Board of Governors ratified new collective bargaining agreements with Unifor Locals 195 and 2458. These agreements have also been ratified by the members of each Local. There are three separate contracts for Unifor Local 2458, which represents 361 clerical staff, operating engineers, refrigeration mechanics and mechanics. Unifor Local 195 represents 27 campus community police and parking services employees.</p>
<p>	Highlights of the new three-year agreements include annual wage increases of 1.5%, and an increase of one year to the recall period for part-time employees on layoff. In addition, the agreements provide greater clarity on the requirements for medical leave approval. The University continued its longstanding commitment that no one would be laid off so that their job can be outsourced. On the matter of recall, the agreements underscore the importance of the requirements of an employee to do the work they are asked to do.</p>
<p>	Dr. Alan Wildeman, President and Vice-Chancellor said, &ldquo;I am delighted that we were able to do the negotiation needed to reach these agreements with our Unifor Locals. The outcome is reflective of our desire to have all employees working with fair and reasonable collective agreements.&rdquo;<br />

<p align="center"><strong>CUPE 1393: Strike Deadline 12:01 am September 8, 2013 </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Faculty and Staff: Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
<p>The University of Windsor will remain open and classes will continue during a CUPE 1393 work stoppage that will begin at 12:45 AM on Sunday, September 8. The University and CUPE 1393 were unable to come to an agreement before the strike deadline. CUPE 1393 represents 281 technical, trades and professional staff at the University of Windsor.</p>
<p>Any disruption to the campus immediately impacts students, faculty, staff, and the community, so the university will be doing everything it can to minimize inconvenience.</p>
<p>Please review the following frequently asked questions and if you have a concern not addressed here, use the &ldquo;Ask a Question&rdquo; function on this site to receive a personal answer. This page will be continually updated as new information becomes available and will be modified to address additional questions as received.</p>
<p><strong>Are picket lines legal?</strong></p>
<p>CUPE 1393 has the right to form a picket line during a legal strike as long as it is not on University property. It is likely that pickets would be located at the entrances to the campus and at parking lots. Pickets may communicate information to try to dissuade you from crossing their picket line. Remember, you have the legal right to come to work. Picket lines must keep moving and allow free passage of non-striking individuals, in and out. There will, however, likely be some delays so be sure to plan your time accordingly. It is illegal for pickets to use threats, force, or to physically block the way.</p>
<p><strong>Are staff members expected to come to work during a work stoppage?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, employees who do not belong to the striking unit have the responsibility and the right to attend work. University operations continue and employees will be paid only upon attendance in accordance with collective agreements and University policy.</p>
<p><strong>Will staff continue to be paid during a work stoppage?</strong></p>
<p>Employees who come to work will continue to be paid during the strike. All efforts will be made to continue payroll on scheduled dates.</p>
<p><strong>How will the University ensure that all employees required to work attend as scheduled?</strong></p>
<p>The University expects all employees to meet their employment obligations. You supervisor will monitor attendance within your unit and report any absences to Human Resources.</p>
<p><strong>Will a leave of absence/vacation be permitted for employees who are not members of CUPE 1393 during a strike?</strong></p>
<p>In general, no changes will be made with respect to scheduling or a leave of absence/vacation for employees who are not members of the striking unit. Though, in certain departments it may not be possible to meet requests for leave of absence/vacation during a work stoppage.</p>
<p><strong>Will sick leave for employees who are not members of the striking unit be permitted during a strike?</strong></p>
<p>Medical certificates that satisfy the employer may be required to substantiate illness or injury. All questions regarding sick leave should be referred to Human Resources.</p>
<p><strong>If I am a member of the striking unit, will I be paid for pre-approved vacation that falls after the strike begins?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, any pre-approved vacation time will be granted vacation pay should it fall after September 8. Your supervisor will need to advise HR about your vacation schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Are students who work on campus expected to cross the picket line?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Students are encouraged to check with their individual supervisors regarding working hours as there may be limited service in areas where students are employed.</p>
<p><strong>Can I recognize a strike by another union?</strong></p>
<p>Those employees who choose to recognize the picket line and do not attend work, will not be paid and are required to report their absence to their supervisor<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Faculty members may recognize a strike by another bargaining unit provided they do so in a manner in keeping with Article 51:02 and 51:03 of the WUFA Collective Agreement.</p>
<p>In those circumstances, please note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		It is the responsibility of the member to inform his/her Head (where available) and the Dean, or the Associate Librarian, as appropriate, of the workload assignments that will not be performed and the amount of time that will be lost by the member during the strike.</li>
<li>
		The time lost during the strike shall be without pay based on a pro-ration of the member&#39;s Normal Salary.</li>
<li>
		Should&nbsp; the member desire to make up such lost time, a plan which outlines how the work is to be made up may be submitted to his/her Head, or Associate Librarian, as appropriate, with a copy to the Dean or University Librarian, as appropriate.</li>
<li>
		Once a plan, approved by the Dean or University Librarian, as appropriate, has been implemented the member&rsquo;s lost pay shall be restored and paid.</li>
<li>
		The member shall have the option to return to work at any time during the strike. It will be the responsibility of the member to notify the Head (where available) and the Dean, or Associate Librarian, as appropriate, if and when he/she returns to work and at this time, normal pay shall resume.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As a faculty member, can I move my classes off campus during a strike?</strong></p>
<p>No. The location of university courses cannot be moved off campus during a work stoppage.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What happens if a student refuses to cross a picket line to attend class?</strong></p>
<p>In the event of a CUPE 1393 strike, the University will remain open and classes will still be scheduled. Should students choose not to attend, they will need to work out what the consequences of those actions will be with each instructor.</p>
<p><strong>What message should I put on my phone or on our departmental website if there is a work stoppage?</strong></p>
